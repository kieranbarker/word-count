# Word Count

Displays the number of words and characters in a block of text in real time as the user types.

I originally got [the idea](https://gist.github.com/cferdinandi/2d47e9e83f33f526eab50b5474a9787c) for this project from [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com).

My second project for his [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com/) was the same but also required a character count, so I just refactored this script to support that as well.
